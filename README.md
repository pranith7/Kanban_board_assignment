# 📝 Kanban Board Assignment

This is an assignment for **YourseAI** where I have built a full-stack task management application with a Kanban board interface. You can find more details about the project requirements in the provided PDF within the repository.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React (instead of Next.js)
  - TailwindCSS
  - Shadcn
  
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MongoDB Atlas (Database)

> **Note**: I have used **React** for the frontend instead of Next.js. While I don’t have experience with Next.js, I am willing to learn it in future projects.

## 📌 Current Status

As of now, the core functionalities are implemented, but there is an issue with state management:

- **State Management Issue**: 
  - After updating, creating, deleting, or dragging tasks on the Kanban board, the browser needs to be reloaded for the changes to reflect. 
  - I am working on fixing this issue and will deploy the final solution to Vercel once resolved. This README will be updated with the Vercel deployment link afterward.

## ⚠️ Deadline Status
